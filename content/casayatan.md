## Hello dear Guest of Casa Yatan

Wonderful that I get to share my home with you!
A few pointers with pics for your ease of stay


## How to get there

Its on Rosa Luxemburg Platz in Berlin Mitte
Ways to get there
Alexanderplatz (S Bahn, Train, U-Bahn) and walk 10 mins
Rosa Luxemburg Platz (Tram, U2, Bus) and walk 2 mins
Rosenthaler Platz (U8, Tram) and walk 8 mins



## I am in the house now

Great, you made it! 

**Wi-Fi**
There is a public wi-fi - it should work for almost everything.
Name: Rosita Lux 
Pass: rosita123

There is an unlimited wi-fi I only share if you promise not to do any piracy (torrent or otherwise) as if you do I get fined.
Let me know and I'll share it iwth you.

**Bedsheets and Towels**
Are in the living room in the beautiful wooden furniture in the drawers. Find a matching pair!

**Trashbags**
There are trashbags in the plastic wardrobe on top of the blue cupboard in the top left cube.
If you feel called to you can also find smaller bags if you want to separate trash

**Taking out the trash**
The trash containers are a little bit out. You need a key for them, there should be a set of keys on the bambu shelf in the corridor next to the phone and router. 

In words:
Go out of the building and turn right, keep walking till you see an entrance with a big bear mural, going right in there and after the tunnel there will be a fenced area with containers in it.

See google maps, upper one is trash, lower one is glass:

**Washing Machine**
The washing machine is at your disposal. A few pointers
- only fill it to max 3/4th 
- make sure you close the internal lid, it should click in

Settings
- Whenever it has been set before you need to turn the nob one whole time for you to be able to turn it on again
- The shortest and easiest setting is "Pflegeleicht 40°" this will take around 1 hour
- If you want to make sure it wrinkles the least press "Fresh Finish" before turning it on 
- Press "Start" when you want to turn it on
- In case you pressed Fresh Finish, when its done you will have to press it again for it to do the final turns

All settings
- Baumwolle - Cotton
- Koch/Bunt - Boil / Colors
- Mischwäsche - Mixed Wash
- Pflegeleicht - Easy Care
- Wolle - Wool
- Fein - Fine 
- Farben - Colors
- Schleudern - Centrifuge
- Spülen & Schleudern - Rinse and Centrifuge

**Oven**
Unfortunately the handle for the oven has fallen off and I havent been able to find a replacement. Please pull it open with a cloth on the right top side of it, looking at replacing the oven altogether soon.


Anything else? Let me know.

Love

Yatan
