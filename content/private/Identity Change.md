# Identity Change

For too long I have thought I am not good enough.
For too long I have longed for my father's approval.
for too long I have disregarded my own desires and needs.
For too long have I treated my body as a dump and neglected it.
For too long have I not given my nervous system the balance of love, stress and rest it needs.
For too long have I not slept in a way that gives me consistent restoration and rest.
For too long have i not been consistent in exercising and deprived myself of strength, balance and fitness.
For too long have i identified with a version of me that doesnt serve me.

Today this changed, i don't identify with that person, that version of me anymore.
From today I identify with the person I know is in me and I desire and aspireto be.

I am an athlete
- I do sports every day because I love it and I know its good for me

I am focused and hard working
- I take time to train my mind and work fully focused making every minute count, also taking breaks periodically
- I am dilligent with everything I do

I play and relax hard, I enjoy the little things
- I practice gratitude every day and communicate it to myself and the people around me
- I seek joy and allow myself to feel it

I am a lifelong learner
- I take time to review and learn every day and week, because humility is the key.

I love myself and act like it
- I want the best for myself and execute on that
- I don't "let it slide" but deal with my demons in a loving way and nurture the best in me and others

i hereby commit to following my own guidelines with love and affection.
