## I am in the house now

Great, you made it! 

**Wi-Fi**
There is a public wi-fi - as if you download anything illegal i'd have to pay its restricted
Name: Rosita Lux 
Pass: rosita123

There is an unlimited wi-fi ill let you know per text.

**Bedsheets and Towels**
Are in the living room in the beautiful wooden furniture in the drawers. Find a matching pair!

**Trashbags**
There are trashbags in the plastic wardrobe on top of the blue cupboard in the top left cube.
If you feel called to you can also find smaller bags if you want to separate trash

**Taking out the trash**
The trash containers are a little bit out. You need a key for them, there should be a set of keys on the bambu shelf in the corridor next to the phone and router. 

In words:
Go out of the building and turn right, keep walking till you see an entrance with a big bear mural, going right in there and after the tunnel there will be a fenced area with containers in it.

See google maps, upper one is trash, lower one is glass:

Yatan
